# Heya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yarne, a 17 year old highly motivated and skilled software developer. I am currently pursuing a career in computer science
as a first year bachelor student. I go by the pseudonyms Vig and Vigintillion online, where I have been actively contributing to the developer
community.

I am an experienced software developer with a diverse skillset, including expertise in desktop application development, front-end and
back-end systems, command-line applications and game development. I have a proven track record, having worked on a variety of projects,
many of which are confidential or have been archived or deleted. I specialize in utilizing lightweight object-oriented programming
languages, such as JavaScript, and am also a dedicated open-source contributor.

I am constantly expanding my knowledge and skillset, currently focusing on Go, C++, cyber security, and networking. 
In addition to my technical abilities, I have a passion for design and user experience, and enjoy creating visually 
appealing and unique websites.

If you have any inquiries or would like to contact me, please do not hesitate to reach out through 
Discord at **.vigintillion** or direct message me on Instagram at **@uibyvig**.
