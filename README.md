# Heya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yarne, a 17-year-old software developer. I go under the pseudonyms Vig and Vigintillion online. I'm a high school
student pursuing a software engineering career.

I develop desktop applications, front & backend systems, command-line applications, bots, and more. I've worked on
numerous projects, more of which are private, archived, or deleted. I predominantly work with lightweight object oriented programming
languages (e.g. JavaScript) and occasionally contribute to open-source software.

I am currently learning Go, C++, cyber security and networking.
I also love designing and developing eye-pleasing and unique websites!

If you'd like to contact me, feel free to do so via Discord: **Vigintillion#6181** or dm me on instagram **@uibyvig**.
