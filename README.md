# Heya! 👋 I'm Yarne

I'm a Computer Science student and open-source developer. I specialize in transforming complex technical challenges into efficient, scalable software, with a strong passion for systems programming and functional paradigms. 

Currently, I'm focusing heavily on **Rust** and **Haskell**, alongside growing my recent open-source projects.

* 🔭 **Currently working on:** [niri-sidebar](https://github.com/Vigintillionn/niri-sidebar)
* 🌱 **Currently exploring:** Compilers, cybersecurity, and low-level systems architecture.
* 📫 **Reach me:** Discord (`.vigintillion`) or Instagram (`@uibyvig`).
